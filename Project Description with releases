The software will create three files in “.csv” format for patient details, visitor details and room status. Patient details and visitor details will take in all the inputs as mentioned in the client requirement section. Depending on the number of patients being admitted to hospital the room status will be updated in a different file.
 
At first symptoms of the patient will be taken as input to patient detail file. If the symptoms does not belong to physical injury or to any chronic disease the patient will not be allocated any room in any wards. Then the other details mentioned in patient details will be taken as input.
 
If the patient has symptoms of physical injury and requires admission he will be admitted to general ward if room is available. Other patient details can be taken as input after room is allocated.
If the patient has symptoms of chronic disease and requires admission he will be admitted to special ward if room is available. Other patient details can be taken as input after room is 
 
A set of symptoms corresponding to physical injury and chronic diseases will be used to evaluate patients’ symptoms.  
Each time a patient needs to be admitted the software will read the room status file and will allow admission of the patient based on the required room availability in a ward.
 
Input to visitor details will be taken when a visitor, visits a patient admitted in hospital.
